[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schultyy/kraken.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/schultyy/kraken)
This is something like a Rss reader. I wanted to have a reader which builds a nice timeline from all of my feeds. Tired of clicking through the blog posts and stuff blog by blog.

This doesn't do any concurrency stuff, it loads all feeds on the main thread. So it could take some time.

## Features
* Load rss feeds
* Build timeline
* Mark as read
* Favs

## Needs to be done

* Concurrency
* App icon
* Nicer design 

# dependencies
* Underscore.m (https://github.com/robb/Underscore.m)
